            Hi! My name is Jaden Law, I am 19 years old and I am from Markham, Ontario. I am currently a first year student majoring in Computer Science at York University. I chose this major because of my interest in coding, and I wish to become a software developer in the future. This was my first time creating a game like this while collaborating with others so I hope you enjoy playing the game as much as I enjoyed creating it!</p></span>
